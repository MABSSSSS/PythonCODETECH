**class 1**
ways of writing : 3 ways
immediate, scripts and IDE
and general introduction , installation

**class:2**
KEYWORDS AND IDENTIFIERS

keywords are reseve words in py.
KW cant be used as var name or identifier.Used to define syntax ans structure .
KW are case sensitive.

Identifier:
names given to identities like class, function and varibales. differentiate one entity from other 

Rules:
combination of upper and lower case or digits (0 to 9) an underscore too.

cant start with digit .
cant use special symbols.

**Class:3**
Namespace :
collection of names holds mapping of every name defined
diff can coexist at given time but completely isolated.
builtin namespace created when we start python interpreter.
Modules can have various functions and classees .
local creared when functioncalled which has all names feined.

module :global naemsapce
funtion local namespace.

Datatype conversion :
converting value of one datatatype toanother datttype .
implicit and explicit type conversion 

python statements:
istructuions python execute if,else,for and while
multiline stats:
can do by adding \ atlast \
Indentations:
e.g:  for i in range(1,22):
        for j in range(1,24):
            print(i,j)

Comments:
 use hash (#) symbol in start for commenting

 Mutliline comments:
  use hash symbol in start of evryline 
   also by triple quotes,either ''' or"""".
   triple for multiline strings as well.

   Docstrings:
    short from of documentation string.
     string that occurs as first stats in module,function .must write function/class does in docstring.

**Class :4**
python variables

location used to store data in memory.
 must hace unique name called identifiers.

 it dont need declaration to reserve memory space.
 var declaration happens automatically when we assign value to variable.
  e.g:
  koubt = 100
  a,b,c =12.32.45

  constant is var whose value cant be changes . container whose values not changed.

  Naming conventions for var and cons:
  Nomenclature should be purpose.
  use camelcase notation
  use capital letters to reprsen concstants
  symblos cnt used.
  constant not chagens
  use undersocre or lowercase for declarations .  

  python shallow and deep copy:
  which store diff of original elments not create copy of nested contents in shallow copy

  deep adds new object and recurcisvely adds the copy of nested objects present in original elments
